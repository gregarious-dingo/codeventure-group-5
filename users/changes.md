# Changes made to CodeVenture

## 1.
- Change Description:
    - All online features such as posting content or chat has been discarded.
- Change Rationale:
    - Online features can not be implemented as the program runs locally.
- Impact Analysis:
    - While this change does discard some of the existing requirements such as NFR-5, NFR-6, NFR-9, NFR-11, Client – Server Architecture and Pipe & Filter Architecture Pattern this will leave no other impact on the system’s other functionalities, architecture, performance or security considerations.
- Benefits of the Change:
    - This allows for the program to be a more streamlined experience, focusing on the main features without any of the distractions or potential safety issues.

## 2.
- Change Description:
    - In-the-face feedback to the learner has been discarded
- Change Rationale:
    - As the program is already straightforward, the need for hand-holding features are unnecessary.
- Impact Analysis:
    - This change will affect some requirements such as REQ-14, REQ-17, REQ-22, REQ-25, REQ-26 and REQ-32. However, this will leave no other impact on the system’s other functionalities, architecture, performance or security considerations.
- Benefits of the Change:
    - This allows the learner to evaluate their progress themselves rather than have unnecessary input thrown to them before they get a chance to try again themselves.
